#V-Handle
This project aims at making a new gmod moderation addon that features simplistic addon systems and a broad range of applications

**DEVELOPERS** <br>
When editting or creating new content for this project please avoid changing any of the _main.lua files, autorun/v-handle.lua file or any of the files in the core folder ( You may however add files to the core folder if it needs to be loaded before the modules )

If you want something changed within the aforementioned files please make a pull request and I'll look into it
##Commands
When typing a command keep these few tips in mind:
* You do not need to type the players full name
* Typing a players steam ID works too
* if you want to target several players put / either side and seperate the names/ids with commas (NOT SPACES) e.g. /Partixel,Code/
